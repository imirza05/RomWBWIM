Cpmtools is a suite of command line utilities which allow access to
CP/M file systems. It is available on many platforms. This document
is targetted at the use of the cpmtools Win32 executables at
the Windows command prompt by Windows users who know how to use
command line utilities and disk images
and who may not wish to create cpmtools executables from
source code... just to use them.</b>

<br>
The source for the <b>latest version of cpmtools</b> is available as
a GNU zipped tape archive from:
<br>

<br>
<br>
The cpmtools source used in cygwin to build both the Windows binary (Executable) versions of
cpmtools 2.9 noted below is available from the
<a href="http://www.cpm8680.com/">www.cpm8680.com Website</a> in a zip file format:
<br>
<br>
<b>
<a href="http://www.cpm8680.com/cpmtools/cpmtools-2.9.zip">http://www.cpm8680.com/cpmtools/cpmtools-2.9.zip</a>
</b>
<br>
<br>
<a name="windows"></a><b>For Windows Users</b> who do not wish to make working programs from source code, a compiled
<b>Native Win32 Binary (Executable)</b> version of cpmtools 2.9 is available from the
<a href="http://www.cpm8680.com/">www.cpm8680.com Website</a> in a zip file format:
<br>
<br>
<b>
<a href="http://www.cpm8680.com/cpmtools/cpmtools-2.9-Win32.zip">http://www.cpm8680.com/cpmtools/cpmtools-2.9-Win32.zip</a>
</b>
<br>
<br>
Just unzip with pathnames intact to the root of your local drive (usually C:)
and open-up a cmd prompt in the \cpmtools directory (Windows XP and Vista users
can click-on the cpmtools XP Shortcut)
and you should be good to go. The document you are reading and the program description documents
that it links to are included in the Windows zip file. To use them just click-on them from Windows explorer and
in the \cpmtools\docs directory and
they will load into your favorite web browser.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
The distribution noted above has the following customizations:</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>The default disk image format is apple-do</b>. This means that if you are working
with Apple II DOS 3.3 order disk images you never need to include the -f apple-do
format option when typing in your command line.
<br>
<br>
<b>The diskdefs file is called \cpmtools\diskdefs</b>. This has been hardcoded
into the executables. This means that you can add the \cpmtools directory
to your PATH and the disk and disk image format definitions file will be found.
Users of earlier versions of Windows than XP that support Win32 will need to open a command
prompt and run \cpmtools\cpmtools.bat to set their PATH.
<br>
<br>
<b>A Windows XP Shortcut has been added for Windows XP Users</b>. This should
also work in Windows Vista. This means that Windows XP and Vista users can just
click on this shortcut in Windows Explorer or the Shortcut can be copied to
the desktop.

<a name="cygwin"></a><b>For cygwin Users</b> who do not wish to make working programs from source code, a compiled
<b>cygwin 5 Binary (Executable)</b> version of cpmtools 2.9 is available from the
<a href="http://www.cpm8680.com/">www.cpm8680.com Website</a> in a zip file format:
<br>

</b>
<br>
<br>
Outside cygwin just unzip with pathnames intact to the root of the drive that the cygwin
version 5 directory is installed on (\cygwin is assumed). If you are doing this inside cygwin
using zip and cygwin is installed on C:, then cd \cygdrive\c before un-zipping.
<br>
<br>
The cygwin installation comes complete with the manpages but not the html manual.
It overlays your cygwin installation so review the zip before installing.

<br>
<br>
Other than that, it is what you would get if you built from scratch then installed
using "make install". If you wish to know more you should download
the source as well.
