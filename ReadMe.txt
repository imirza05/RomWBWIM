This is the SVN root of the RomWBW project.

The standard SVN subdirectores exist including
trunk, branches, and tags.

The most recent released version of the project
is available at /tags/Release.  Unless you have
a good reason to believe otherwise, you should
use that location to retrieve files.

The "work in progress" is maintained in /trunk.
Feel free to take a look, but expect it to
contain stuff that is not fully baked and it
may not even build properly.
