Building a Custom ROM
---------------------

At present, the build environment assumes you are running
a current version of Microsoft Windows (either 32-bit or
64-bit).

If you are using Linux, David Giles has contributed a Linux
makefile that should work for you.  Please read the
LinuxBuild.txt file for more information.

All required tools are included in the distribution.  You
should not need anything other than what comes as part of
Windows or as part of the distribution.

In summary, the process involves the 4 steps below:

  1) Create/update configuration file

  2) Update/Add/Delete any files you want incorporated in
     the ROM Disk

  3) Run the build script (or makefile if you prefer) and
     confirm there are no errors.

  4) Burn the resultant ROM image and try it.

The process is really very simple.  In fact, you can
essentially skip steps 1 & 2 if you want to try simply
building one of the existing configurations.

Each of the 4 steps above is described in more detail
below.

1. Create/Update Configuration File
-----------------------------------

The settings for a build are primarily controled by
a configuration file that is included in the build
process.  In order to customize your settings, you
need to modify an existing configuration file or
create your own.

If you look in the Source directory, you will see
a series of files named config_xxxx_yyyy.asm.  Each of
them corresponds to one of the standard configurations
listed in the ROMList.txt file.

You have two choices.  You can simply modify the existing
configuration file that is closest to your situation, or
you can copy it to a new config_xxxx_yyyy.asm file and modify
that.  I recommend that you copy one to your own name so
that you will always have the unmodified standard configuration
files left in place.  So, for example, you could just
copy config_ZETA_std.asm to config_ZETA_wayne.asm.  You MUST
name your config file as config_xxxx_yyyy.asm.  The xxxx's
must match your platform (N8VEM, ZETA, N8, S2I, or S100).
The yyyy's can be whatever you want.

The config files are simply text files with various
settings.  Open your target config file with your
favorite text editor and modify the settings as desired.

Unfortunately, I have not yet documented each of the
settings in detail; that will be a separate document
provided in the future.  However, there are comments
in the config file that will probably be sufficient
for the most part.

2. Update/Add/Delete ROM Disk Files
-----------------------------------

The files that are included on the ROM Disk of your
ROM are copied from a set of directories during the
build process.  This allows you to have complete
flexibility over the files you want included in your
ROM.

If you look at the RomDsk directory, you will see
a variety of subdirectories.  These subdirectories
contain the files that will be included in the
ROM disk.  The build process will determine
which subdirectories to include files from based
on the following rules:

First, all files from either std_512 or std_1024 will
be incuded depending on on the size of the ROM you
are building.  If you are building a 512KB ROM, then
all the files from std_512KB will be included.  If you
are building a 1MB ROM, then all the files from std_1024KB
will be included.  Essentialy, the files in std_1204KB are
a superset of the ones in std_512KB because there is more
space available for the ROM drive.

Second, all files from the directory that corresponds to
your configuration file will be included.  If you build
the "ZETA_std" configuration, all files in cfg_ZETA_std will
be added.  Note that these files will be in addition
to the files from the std_XXXKB directory.

If you created your own config file (like config_ZETA_wayne.asm
described above), you MUST create a subdirectory within
the RomDsk directory and populate it with the files
you want added.  Normally, you would include the
files from the original standard config.  So, if
you created config_ZETA_wayne.asm from config_ZETA_std.asm,
then you would create a subdirectory in RomDsk called
cfg_ZETA_wayne and copy all the files from cfg_ZETA_std to
cfg_ZETA_wayne.

3. Run the Build Process
------------------------

NOTE: The process described here is the more commonly
used build script.  If you wish to use a makefile
instead, refer to the comments in the makefile in
the Source directory as an alternative to the
process described here.

The build involves running commands at the command
prompt.  From a Command Prompt window, you will need
to change to the high level directory for the build.
Normally, you would be changing to the RomWBW directory
unless you renamed it.

First, you will need to build the components that are
common to all configurations.  These components do not
require any configuration.  To build these, use the
following commands and ensure that they complete
without error:

	BuildZCPR-DJ
	BuildApps2

To run the main build and be prompted for required information,
just enter "Build".  You will be prompted for the information
described below and the build should run.  If an error is
encountered, the build should stop and display an error
in red text.

If you immediately receive the error "the execution of 
scripts is disabled on this system", then you will need to 
change the PowerShell Execution-Polcy to "RemoteSigned".
To do this, you need to right-click on FixPowerShell.cmd and
choose "Run as Administrator" to make the change.  If is
critical that you right-click and use "Run as Administrator"
or the change will not work (you will get an error
indicating "Access to the registry denied" if you fail to
use "Run as Administrator".

The build script will prompt you for the following information
which you will need to provide (don't worry, it is simple):

Platform:

Respond with the name of the platform that you are targeting.
It must be one of N8VEM, ZETA, N8, S2I, or S100.

Configuration:

Respond with the name of the configuration you wish to build.
A list of all available configurations is displayed for your
convenience.  For example, if you are building the provided
ZETA_std configuration, just enter "std".  If you have created a
custom configuration as described above, you would enter
"wayne".

ROM Size [512|1024]:

Respond with either "512" for a 512KB ROM build or "1024" for a
1MB ROM build.  Only the two choices are possible at this time.
It is important that you choose a ROM size that is no larger than
the szie of the ROM you will ultimately be burning.  This is 
dependant on your hardware.

At this point, the build should run and you will see output related
to the assembler runs and some utility invocations.  Just review
the output for any obvioius errors.  Normally, all errors will
cause the build to stop immediately and display an error message
in red.

You will see some lines in the output indicating the amount of
space variouis components have taken.  You should check these
to make sure you do not see any negative numbers which would
indicate that you have included too many features/drivers for
the available memory space.  Here are examples of the lines
showing the space used:

	DATA space remaining: 39 bytes.
	BOOT LOADER space remaining: 3503 bytes.
	CBIOS space remaining: 161 bytes.
	DBGMON space remaining: 860 bytes.
	ROMX space remaining: 8191 bytes.
	BOOT LOADER space remaining: 3503 bytes.

4. Deploy the ROM
-----------------

If you look in the Output directory.  You should find the following files:

     <config>.rom - binary ROM image to burn to EEPROM
     <config>.sys - system image that can be written to the start of a
                    disk to enable boot from disk functionality
     <config>.com - executable version of the system image that can be
                    copied via xmodem to a running system to test
                    the build.

The actual ROM image is the file ending in .rom.  It should be exactly
512KB or 1MB depending on the ROM size you chose.  Simply burn the .rom
image to your ROM and install it in your hardware.

Specifying Build Options on Command Line
----------------------------------------

If you don't want to be prompted for the options to the "Build"
command, you can specify the options right on the command line.

For example:

	Build ZETA std 512

In this case, you will not be prompted.  This is useful if you
wish to automate your build process.
