To build the software on LINUX:


1.  Copy the entire Tasm32 installation folder from the Windows environment
    to the LINUX system in whatever manner you find convenient.  You must
    remove the CR from the lines of text files (using mcopy or
    other such utility).

2.  Move to the "src" directory and rename "MAKEFILE.UNX" as "makefile".

3.  Execute "make".  The resulting executable will be named "tasm".

4.  Copy the executable to a place in your "PATH" and set the TASMTABS
    environment variable to point to the location of the table files.
