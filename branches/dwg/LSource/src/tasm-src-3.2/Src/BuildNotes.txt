To build the software from the source distribution:

1.  Install Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0

2.  Extract the TASM archive file tasm32sr.zip using PKUNZIP into 
        an empty directory.

3.  Execute Microsoft Visual C++ and open the Tasm32.dsw file.  

4.  Select the Build menu, then "Build Tasm32.exe".

5.  Note that both a release and debug version can be built
        (selectable under the Build/Set Active Configuration).

6.  Note that the executable, as-built, is named Tasm32.exe,
         but is renamed Tasm.exe in the TASM distribution.
