This file, "allfiles.lbr" is the complete contents of my A: drive,
on which I develop all my apps and utilities. Once you have your
system running with storage (ppide,ide,sd,...), configure to use
DM_PPIDE or similar so the mass storage is on A: B: C: & D:.

Unpack this file onto A: and you will be all set to build the apps.

You will also have enough to get you going writing your own.

Good luck,
