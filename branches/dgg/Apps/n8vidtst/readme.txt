readme - n8vidtst

The n8vidtst program is a preliminary test program to help determine
that the TMS9918 chip on the N8 is working correctly in text mode.

It displays four screens on the composite video, each displaying 64
of the possible 256 characters in my prelimiinary character set.

Everything is soft with the TMS9918, and the font is a set of character
array initializers in TMS9918.H.

Aztec C for CP/M-80 is used to compile and link this program.

The file N8VIDTST.CPM should be downloaded and renamed to n8vidtst.com
to run under CP/M on the N8.
